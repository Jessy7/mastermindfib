The number of code pegs and if the duplicates are allowed depends of the level, so the player could even choose four code pegs of the same color. The chosen pattern is placed in the four holes covered by the shield, visible to the codemaker but not to the codebreaker.\n" +
                "2. CODEBREAKER : The codebreaker tries to guess the pattern, in both order and color, within ten turns. Each guess is made by placing a row of code pegs on the decoding board.\n" +
                "3. CODEMAKER : Once placed, the codemaker provides feedback by placing from zero to four key pegs in the small holes of the row with the guess.\n" +

                "  If there are duplicate colours in the guess, they cannot all be awarded a key peg unless they correspond to the same number of duplicate colours in the pattern.\n" +

                "   * if the pattern is green-green-red-red\n" +

                "   * nothing for the third green as there is not a third green in the code,\n" +
                "   * and a red peg for the red." +
                "  No indication is given of the fact that the pattern also includes a second red.\n" +
                "4. CODEBREAKER : Once feedback is provided, another guess is made; guesses and feedback continue to alternate until either the codebreaker guesses correctly, or ten incorrect guesses are made.\n" +
